    "1. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed.  \n",
    "2. Install dependencies either by:  \n",
    "   - Using pdm (preferred):  \n",
    "     » pdm install  \n",
    "   - Or manually with pip:  \n",
    "     » pip install -r requirements.txt  \n",

    "## Quick-Start\n",
    "1. Configure Foundry environment variables, as described in src/flow/config/flow_config.py:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  **Authentication (choose one option):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Option 1 (Recommended): API Key\n",
    "      - export FOUNDRY_API_KEY='your_api_key' # Found in FCP Console → Settings → API Keys tab\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Option 2: Email/Password\n",
    "      - export FOUNDRY_EMAIL='your_email@example.com'  \n",
    "      - export FOUNDRY_PASSWORD='your_password'  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Submit an example task using flow_example.yaml:\n",
    "   » flow submit flow_example.yaml\n",

    "3. Retrieve auctions and place/cancel spot bids.\n",
    "4. (Optionally) create persistent storage using StorageManager.\n",
